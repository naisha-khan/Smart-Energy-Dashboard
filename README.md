Core Calculations
javascript// CO₂ Savings Calculation
co2Saved = (gridEmissions - renewableEmissions) × dailyConsumption
gridEmissions = consumption × 0.82 kg/kWh (Indian grid factor)

// Monthly Cost Optimization
monthlyCost = monthlyConsumption × (renewableRatio × ₹4.2 + gridRatio × ₹7.5)

// Environmental Impact
treesEquivalent = co2Saved × 0.02 × 30 days
carKmOffset = co2Saved × 4.6 km/kg
